"Utter Garbage!" MrWatson-de


In FileMaker Everything is Text - Nooooooot!(*)

See the example file.

And get the MBS plugin.

It does wonderful things, like telling you the data type of anything you pass it.

(*) Don't get me wrong, I know that under the hood data is stored as text in FileMaker - this isn't about that.

Rather it is about this:

and THAT is utter garbage!
